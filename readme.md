# Servo Test In Python

My first take at using Python and RPi GPIO was a bit different than using an Arduino and C. The same general principles hold true for PWM. There is a frequency and a duty cycle. The time for each to achieve full actuation is what needed to be learned here. The R&D of this script was for the movement of a camera gimbal in an underwater housing.

His high school team building weather balloons which use [servos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGwhx1MYXUs) is truly amazing. If one is looking at this repo for guidance or refresher, go back to lesson 27 on PWM that describes how to use GPIO on the Pi.
