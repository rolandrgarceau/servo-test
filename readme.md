# Servo Test In Python

My first take at using Python and RPi GPIO was a bit different than using an Arduino and C. The same general principles hold true for PWM. There is a frequency and a duty cycle. The time for each to achieve full actuation is what needed to be learned here. The R&D of this script was for the movement of a camera gimbal in an underwater housing.
